Product Tracking is a crucial process that enables the tracing and locating of a product or
 commercial item, including essential details like its time of movement, location,
 ownership, and other significant information. In a supply chain system, it is imperative to
 maintain the integrity of the products to prevent the delivery of counterfeit or undesirable
 items to end users. To achieve this, product tracking and fake product identification
 mechanisms play a vital role. These systems ensure the well-being of all products in the
 supply chain and provide access to valuable information such as timestamps and
 historical locations of specific products for every participant in the supply chain, be it
 distributors, retailers, or manufacturers. Key terms relevant to this process include
 "tracking," "Ethereum," "Blockchain," "Smart Contracts," "Supply Chain," and
 "Products."
